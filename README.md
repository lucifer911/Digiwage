To install MN on vps, run the following commands. It will ask you to enter your private key. ( make sure you have your private key before you run your the script. )

>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucifer911/Digiwage/master/install-digi.sh

>rm -r install-digi.sh

# Local wallet

Once the script is done It will spit out a line that you need to enter into your masternode.conf file of your local wallet.
